( Team Member : Soham Roy, Biswajit Nayak , Somraj Paul )
Arduino based soil moisture sensor, Arduino UNO and DST22 sensor are used in this project. At first the model was build to collect relevant data of the project ,
After that Machine learning algorithm is used to predict the moisture of the field without using soil moisture sensors.
